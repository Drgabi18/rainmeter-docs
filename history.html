This will return the file name of the currently loaded .ini file. Path is not included, but can be obtained with #CURRENTPATH##CURRENTFILE#.

NowPlayingPlugin: Added SHUFFLE and REPEAT types and accompanying SetShuffle and SetRepeat bangs.
Read <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-NowPlaying">manual entry</a> for usage instructions. VLC users should install the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vlc-libcad/">libcad_plugin 1.0.1</a> update and foobar2000 users should install the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/foo-rainmeter/downloads/detail?name=foo_rainmeter103.zip">foo_rainmeter.dll 1.0.3</a> update.

DEBUG messages from plugins are now only logged if Debug= is set on the skin or Rainmeter.
Details are <a href="http://www.rainmeter.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=55719#p55719">Here</a>.

August 21, 2011
Added a new Magic Quote feature, consisting of three quotes """. This will allow you to "escape" quotes you need to send in a bang to Rainmeter.

WebParser: Errors and warnings are now logged as errors and warnings (instead of as debug).

NowPlayingPlugin: Minor changes, fix to "current track functionality".

August 14, 2011
Changed print() function in Lua to allow printing tables in to log columns.

Fix for Rainstaller to correct a UAC issue on some user's systems.

August 7, 2011
Several minor bug fixes for Lua scripting functionality.

Tweak to performance when writing network statistics.

Fix for Cumulative=1 on Net/xx measures not working correctly.

July 31, 2011
Added new !SetOption / !SetOptionGroup bangs.
Allows changing most "settings" on a measure or meter via a bang. Note that DynamicVariables=1 is NOT required to use this functionality.

!SetOption [Meter] [Option] [Value] (Config)
!SetOption [Measure] [Option] [Value] (Config)
!SetOptionGroup [Group] [Option] [Value] (Config)

Examples:
!SetOption "MeterOne" "FontSize" 11
!SetOption "MeasureOne" "Formula" "((MeasureTwo * 4)/10)"

Added new Meter:GetOption() / Measure:GetOption() functions to Lua scipting.
Allows a Lua script to retrieve most "settings" from any measure or meter in a skin.

Examples:
MyMeter = SKIN:GetMeter("MeterOne")
MyMeter:GetOption("FontSize")
MyMeasure = SKIN:GetMeter("MeasureOne")
MyMeasure:GetOption("Formula")

Added support for Regular Expressions in Substitute on all measures.
Allows using Regular Expressions to replace values returned by a measure.
Requires RegExpSubstitute=1 on the measure. See <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Measures-GeneralSettings">Manual Page</a> for details

Added ability to "escape" real variables and measures as follows: #*RealVar*# / [*RealMeasure*]
This allows a "literal" #VarName# or [MeasureName] to be used without Rainmeter resolving them to their values.
A case where this would be useful is to use the new !SetOption to set a meter's "FontColor" to literally #SomeOtherColor#, which is defined in [Variables] instead of having what is set resolved to the current value of #SomeOtherColor#.

Script: Fixed Lua crash on refresh when Update() in the script has an error.

Script: Fixed that the value of the Script measure is not reset when an error occurs.

Script: Fixed that AutoScale/Scale/Percentual/NumOfDecimals were not applied for MeasureName=ScriptMeasure

NowPlayingPlugin:
Fixed that the OpenPlayer bang didn't work correctly since r848
Fixed that the "SetPosition +n" bang didn't work correctly
OpenPlayer bang with foobar2000 now opens foobar2000 maximized regardless of previous state

Fixed that Rainmeter crashes when [] is in bang. E.g. !SetVariable test "blaa[]"

July 24, 2011
Several improvements to the NowPlaying plugin:
Track title was not updating when playing a radio stream with Winamp.
foobar2000: Added support for the SetPosition bang (<a href="http://foo-rainmeter.googlecode.com/files/foo_rainmeter101.zip">foo_rainmeter.dll 1.0.1</a> required)
foobar2000: Fixed that TITLE/ARTIST/ALBUM was a space when empty (i.e. " " instead of "")

July 17, 2011
FolderInfo: Fixed an issue that InfoType=FolderSize would not return a value larger than 4GB.

Many minor improvements to internal Rainmeter code addressing performance and reliability.

July 10, 2011
Optimized some internal Rainmeter code to reduce processing time on startup and on refreshing.

NowPlaying: Fixed Play/Pause issue with MusicBee.

Improved performance when reading network statistics from Rainmeter.stats.

Removed SkinAuthor method from PluginBridge. Plugin authors should read author from [Rainmeter] instead.

Added !CommandMeasure bang.
This replaces !PluginBang, which is being depreciated and should not be used in new skins. The reason for this change is that !CommandMeasure can be used to both send a bang to a plugin as !PluginBang did before, but can also be used to send a bang to any measure that can accept it. As of now, only the Measure=Script (Lua) measures can make use of this, but this may change over time.
The syntax is slightly different from !PluginBang as it is:
!CommandMeasure "MeasureName" "Arguments"
instead of:
!PluginBang "MeasureName Arguments'

Changes to Lua with Rainmeter.
We are actively working to evolve the interface between Rainmeter and Lua to make it easier to use, more flexible, and to position the code for big improvements and additions coming soon! More details and examples are available <a href="http://rainmeter.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=52335#p52335">HERE</a>. The first round changes are:
Eliminated the need to use the complicated tolua.cast method of initializing a string meter in order to manipulate its value with SetText().
MyMeterStringValue = tolua.cast(SKIN:GetMeter("SomeMeter"), "CMeterString")
has been depreciated by allowing for just:
MyMeter = SKIN:GetMeter("ExampleStringMeter")
Which will allow you to perform any supported action on any type of meter, including SetText().

Depreciated the GetValue() and GetStringValue() functions used to "return" values to the Script measure in the skin.
You will now return values from the script to the measure in the skin by including a "return" statement in the Update() function of the script. You may return either a number or string value as needed:
return 99
Returns both the number 99 and the string "99"
return "99"
Returns both the string "99" and the number 99
return "Hello World"
Returns the string "Hello World"

This does not effect the use of GetValue() and GetStringValue() functions to retrieve the current value of a measure in the skin. Using these functions is still the correct way to do that.

Added new GetVariable() function.
This is an somewhat easier to understand variant of the current ReplaceVariables() used now to retrieve the current value of a variable from the skin. If you want to "get" a single variable value from the skin, use GetVariable("varname"). If you want to "replace" multiple variables in a string or function in your Lua code with the values from the skin, use ReplaceVariables("Currently my vars are: "..#var1#.." and "..#var2#.." and "..#var3#)

ScriptFile= may now be a relative or fully described path in the script measure in the skin.
ScriptFile=file.lua
ScriptFile=LuaFiles\file.lua
ScriptFile=#CURRENTPATH#file.lua
ScriptFile=C:\LuaFiles\file.lua

July 3, 2011
WebParser: Added UTF-16LE support using CodePage=1200. 

Rainstaller: Fixed an issue with SkinPath not being correctly read with portable installs. 

Changes to NowPlaying plugin:
Support added for VLC media player. Check installation instructions at <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-NowPlaying#playerlist">manual page</a>.
Fixed: TITLE was empty when listening to radio stations with Winamp.
Fixed: Metadata may not be updated until full refresh after closing one of multiple NowPlaying based skins.

Removed trailing zeros from calculated numbers.
Rainmeter will no longer automatically add zeros to a calculated number to force a constant 5 decimal places. The amount of "precision" will be only that required to support the value, up to 5 decimal places. This will eliminate the need to use Substitute=".00000":"" to strip the unneeded precision off of integer values returned by a Calc and used in other measures or meters as a string.
1.00000 -> 1
1.01000 -> 1.01
1.01001 -> 1.01001

Made "Rainmeter" optional in the name of a bang.
For example, !RainmeterShowMeter and !ShowMeter are now treated equally.

Changed the illustro suite of skins to use new "!Rainmeter"-less bangs.
Note: If you have directly edited the illustro skins to change them, your changed .ini files will be saved in \Backup in \Skins.

June 26, 2011
Fixed a display issue when a skin is dragged to the top of the virtual screen.

Fixed the problem where skins would "flicker" when set to "On Desktop" and the Windows "Show Desktop" feature is used.

Updated the installer to add the installation of VC++ 2010 SP1 libraries if needed on a user's system.

Changes to NowPlaying plugin:
Added PlayerType=STATUS (returns 1 when player is open, 0 when closed)
Winamp interface: Fixed that file paths over about 100 chars did not display all metadata
CAD interface: Added workaround for issue caused by Rainmeter running as elevated and player running as normal process (Windows Vista+)

June 19, 2011
Corrected the issue that PlayerName=, TrackChangeAction=, and DisableLeadingZero= were shared with all running skins, making it impossible to have multiple player skins at once.

June 12, 2011
Added SetPosition and Pause bangs to NowPlaying plugin.

NowPlayingPlugin: Added interface to receive MSN/Windows Live Messenger 'Listening to' notifications sent by various players. (e.g. Media Player Classic, Zune) and fixed crash when using the WinAmp interface in multiple skins.

June 5, 2011
Minor tweaks to NowPlaying plugin

Fixed an issue with FinishAction on a WebParser measure not working correctly if #CURRENTCONFIG# was not specified.

Changes to Uptime measure to work better on Vista/Win7 systems.

May 29, 2011
Added support for MusicBee and MediaMonkey to NowPlaying plugin.
See <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-NowPlaying">NowPlaying documentation</a> for details.

Improved image caching when image scaling is not required, to reduce resource usage.

May 22, 2011
Added NowPlaying media plugin as noted above.

Fix to Rainstaller when a full restore of a .rmskin made with RainBackup is done containing the "Backup" folder from \Skins.

May 15, 2011
Fixed an issue with Rainstaller that was preventing it from restoring full backup .rmskins made with RainBackup.

Changes to the Rainmeter source build process to better support those using Visual Studio in both 32 and 64 bit architectures.

May 8, 2011
Fixed a bug with Measure=Registry returning invalid DWORD values.

Improved fix in r800 that correctly handles SkinPath in Rainmeter.ini for portable installations.

April 17, 2011
Change to how network statistics are stored.
The network statistics are now stored in a separate Rainmeter.stats file in the %APPDATA%\Rainmeter folder, the same folder where Rainmeter.ini is kept. This will now allow for resetting the statistics by either the current bang !RainmeterResetStats, or by simply deleting this new file. This also resolves issues with using RainThemes or installing a suite with a theme in a .rmskin replacing a user's statistics.

Fixed an issue with the Rainmeter icon on the System Tray/Notification Area disappearing when Explorer was restarted.

Fixed an issue that Roundline "Shift" parameters were not working when Solid=0 was set on the meter.

Fixed a problem where SkinPath was read from Rainmeter.ini in portable installations.
This would cause an issue if you renamed or moved the folder in which Rainmeter was installed in portable mode. Bug found by our user 'calav3ra the great'.

April 10, 2011
Added the NowPlaying media player plugin by developer and overall Rainmeter superstar poiru.

This is a new plugin to support multiple media players, with full support for AIMP, Foobar2000, MediaMonkey, MusicBee, iTunes, VLC, WinAmp, and WMP, and more! Partial support is also provided a bunch of other players such as Spotify. See the documentation at <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-NowPlaying">NowPlaying Plugin</a> for details and usage instructions.

Added support for Aero Glass "blur" effects on skins!
This will allow you to have the Windows Aero effect, where your desktop background is "blurred" behind your skins or parts of skins. Windows Vista or Windows 7 is required or the new settings are ignored by Rainmeter. See <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Skins-AeroBlur">Aero Blur</a> for details and an example skin.

Improvements to FolderInfo plugin.
FolderInfo now returns size in bytes. If using InfoType=FolderSizeStr, (which until now autoscaled the value internally) AutoScale=1 should be added to the meter(s). While this does change the behavior, it allows for the use of Scale, NumOfDecimals, etc. that weren't possible prior to this change without an extra Calc measure.

Fixes InputText plugin failing if a "config name" folder had a space in it.

Fix for the CoreTemp plugin to address a mutex handle leak.

Added image caching system to the internal Rainmeter code.
Reduces memory resources when a single image is used repeatedly in a skin. For example, you might create a single image with multiple areas, and use ImageCrop to display some area based on the value of a measure. Rainmeter will no longer load the image multiple times in memory.

New option for Uptime meter
Setting added to disable the addition of days to hours when days (%4) is not specified in the Format= setting. Use AddDaysToHours=1/0 to control this option.

Some bug fixes and improvements to VirtualDesktops plugin from Patrick at Dexpot

"Silent" installation of Rainmeter now available.
Instructions and settings available at <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Installation">Rainmeter Installation</a>.

Rainmeter development environment updated to Visual C++ 2010.

Rainmeter now requires WinXP SP2 / Win2003 SP1 / WinVista or Win7.
Support for Win2k (Windows 2000) is not provided in the new VC++ 2010 development environment.

		<p>New statement / option for WebParser to automatically decode html <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">Character References</a>.</p>
		<p><code>DecodeCharacterReference=0 | 1 | 2 | 3</code> (default 0)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>0: Does nothing. (default)</li>
			<li>1: Decodes both numeric character references and character entity references.</li>
			<li>2: Decodes only numeric character references.</li>
			<li>3: Decodes only character entity references.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Improved the PLAY command so it works more like a !bang does:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ButtonCommand=PLAY #SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=PLAY "#SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav"</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=!execute [PLAY #SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav]</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=!execute [PLAY "#SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav"]</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fix an issue with the "ClickThrough" skin setting broken in an earlier beta.</li>
	<li>Major visual / interface changes to the "About" dialog. Should make this a much more valuable tool for "debugging" skins.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Win7AudioPlugin updated to version 1.6.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>New bangs Mute/Unmute</li>
			<li>Volume shows -1 when muted</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where dynamic variables would be reset to default when Windows "WorkArea" is reset by changing the screen resolution or a screensaver is activated.</li>
	<li>Minor fixes to WebParser for a memory leak and routines to interact with Rainmeter "window".</li>
	<li>Changed to allow substituting quote characters in Substitute= statements. This is done by using single quotes to surround the first part of the "find":"replace" pair. So Substitute='"':"" would remove all quotes from the text.</li>
	<li>Single and double quotes MUST be "mismatched" on the "find:replace" pairs when using single quotes as a delimiter, or the Substitute will fail. Example: Substitute='"':"None" will replace a quote with the word None. Substitute="None":'"' will replace the word None with a quote. However, Substitute='"':'None' will fail, as you can't use single quotes on both sides of the "find:replace" pairs. An easier to read example is Substitute='red':'blue', which will fail.</li>
	<li>Updated the pcre (Regular Expression) library from 6.4 to 8.10. The pcre change log is at <a href="http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt">Change Log</a></li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where certain invalid RegExp statements could crash Rainmeter.</li>
	<li>Simplified and improved the Rainstaller user interface.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Added new !bangs to change "settings" in Rainmeter.ini for current / group / all skins at once.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>!RainmeterDraggable/!RainmeterDraggableGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterKeepOnScreen/!RainmeterKeepOnScreenGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterClickThrough/!RainmeterClickThroughGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges/!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges [parm1] (Config | *)</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup [parm1] [GroupName]</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Parm1:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>-1 toggles the setting.</li>
			<li>0 forces the setting to off.</li>
			<li>1 forces to setting to on.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WebParser: Fix for issue where StringIndexes from previous call to WebParser would remain even if the item no longer exists. This fixes a long standing problem with uTorrent skins for example, when the last item was removed from uTorrent but remained displayed in the skin until a refresh was done.</li>
	<li>Added MeasureName2 as an alternative to SecondaryMeasureName in Meter=Histogram.</li>
	<li>Changes to CALC measure to remove any and all restrictions on the string case of function names. Calc measures are now completely case-insensitive, with the exception of the "b/o/x" character when specifying the base of a number, this must be lower case.</li>
	<li>Added new PluginMediaKey plugin by poiru. <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-MediaKey">PluginMediaKey</a>.</li>
	<li>Some minor improvements to MouseOver/MouseLeave actions.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller to close RainBrowser if it is running when a skin is installed, to eliminate a problem with open files.</li>
	<li>Fix by elestel to iTunes plugin: iTunesPlugin did not handle AboutToPromptUserToQuitEvent</li>
	<li>Added new #ROOTCONFIGPATH# variable. This will contain the path to the highest level folder under \Skins for the current config. #ROOTCONFIGPATH#Settings\UserVariables.inc can be used to have an @Include work even if you move a skin to another "suite" for instance.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the layout of the Rainmeter manual. The manual is now exclusively online. The "Help" context menu item will launch the appropriate (release or beta) version of the manual in your default web browser. The Rainmeter.chm help file is no longer included in the build or installed on your PC.</li>
	<li>Added new !RainmeterWriteKeyValue bang. !RainmeterWriteKeyValue "Section" "Key" "Value" ("FileSpec"), where "FileSpec" is an optional parameter. If FileSpec is not present, the change is automatically done in the currently running skin file. If the bang is executed from the command line, FileSpec is required. FileSpec must be either in the \Skins or %APPDATA%\Rainmeter paths. This can be used to permanently change any Key=Value setting in any .ini or .inc file. (Including Rainmeter.ini)</li>
	<li>Changes to MouseLeaveAction to make it more reliable and faster. This should eliminate having to put MouseLeaveAction in the [Rainmeter] section to ensure detection.</li>
	<li>Made the "About" dialog a bit larger by default. Other cosmetic changes to this dialog.</li>
	<li>Fixed WifiStatusPlugin so it no longer closes WLAN handle when skin is closed even if another skin is still using it</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where an invalid Format= code in a Time or Uptime measure would crash Rainmeter. Invalid formats are now written to the debug log and the measure just gracefully fails.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller so that a default Rainmeter plugin will not be overwritten if an author includes it by mistake in a .rmskin file.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Rainmeter was detecting an incorrect value for %APPDATA% in a multi-user environment.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where check marks of context menu items in configs/root/variants menu are cleared if !RainmeterDeactivateConfig/!RainmeterToggleConfig is used.</li>
	<li>Minor fix to new "groups" function for configs.</li>
	<li>Added root folder of a config on the skin context menu</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the context menu did not close when focus was given to another windows element.</li>
	<li>Many additions to the supported Windows Messages that Rainmeter will respond to, allowing 3rd-party applications to query Rainmeter for paths, currently loaded configs, etc. These changes are courtesy of JamesAC and Patrick from Dexpot.</li>
	<li>Added the Win7AudioPlugin plugin by Reiswaffle.</li>
	<li>Added the PluginVirtualDesktops plugin from Patrick at Dexpot. This will provide support for Virtual Desktop Management tools like Dexpot and VirtuaWin.</li>
	<li>Added new "version checking" functionality, with DisableVersionChecking= setting in Rainmeter.ini and on "About" dialog.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the RainBrowser GUI.</li>
	<li>Major re-design of the Rainmeter and Skins context menus</li>
	<li>Fix to Calc measure to properly allow use of numbering systems other than decimal using a prefix of 0b (binary) 0x (hex) 0o (octal) on the numbers.</li>
	<li>Added "Group=" to meters and measures in skins, and in Rainmeter.ini to support configs. This allows many !bangs to operate on multiple entities at once without multiple !bang statements.</li>
	<li>Major improvement to "logging" in Rainmeter, including new context menu support.</li>
	<li>Addition of support for multiple monitors when using DesktopWorkArea. This change is courtesy of user Jott.</li>
	<li>Addtion of "ToolTip" functionality, so meters can have standard Windows tooltips when hovered over.</li>
	<li>Improvement to image quality when scaling images</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rainmeter 1.2</h2>
<h3>24 June, 2010</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Major improvements to how Rainmeter works with multiple monitors.</li>
	<li>New WebParser settting "DownloadFile=" to allow local storage and naming of downloaded images.</li>
	<li>New !Bang - !RainmeterRefreshApp. Allows full Rainmeter refresh from a skin or command line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Issue where DynamicVariables=1 disabled UpdateDivider.</li>
	<li>FIXED: LineColor did not use the values of Dynamic Variables in Meter=Line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Inconsistent numerical value via DynamicVariables ( issue 130 )</li>
	<li>FIXED: Problem with WebParser and "local files" with Cyrillic chars in the path. (issue 139)</li>
	<li>The coded character set of the logfile is changed to UTF-8. (ccs=UTF-8) <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb(VS.80).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>
	<li>"MS Shell Dlg 2" is now used for the ABOUT dialog box. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282187">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>

	<li>Added Rainmeter version information to the right click (Properties / Details) menu for Rainmeter.exe.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with Rainmeter properly using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) network shared drives / folders, such as "\\SERVER".</li>
	<li>Fixed a small bug in @Include routines that impacted some @Inlcude and MeterStyle combinations.</li>
	<li>The RANDOM math function was case sensitive, requiring "Random" only. Now case insensitive.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where a very high Update rate could cause problems closing a skin.</li>
	<li>Changed the HighBound parameter for RANDOM to return up to and including the number in HighBound instead of just up to.</li>
	<li>Added #CRLF# as a built-in variable to allow putting a carriage return / line feed in a string meter.</li>
	<li>Changed the undocumented LG (logarithm) function to be LOG and added to the manual.</li>
