<h2 id="2.3.3">Rainmeter 2.3.3 <small>(r1522)</small></h2>
<h3>3 July, 2012</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a new, improved .rmskin (Rainmeter Skin Package) system designed to make distribution of your creations easier. The most visible change is a new Rainmeter Skin Packager application available from the Manage dialog in Rainmeter. This will allow you to quickly select skins, themes and custom plugins to add to your distribution, and create a .rmskin package users can install by simply double-clicking. Please note that as of this release of Rainmeter, both deviantART.com and Customize.org will only accept the .rmskin format for new uploads. If you want to distribute your skins on these popular sites, be sure to check out the new Rainmeter Skin Packager.</li>
	<li>Support for a new @Resources folder in your skins makes storing, using and distributing images, fonts, sounds and addons much easier and more reliable.</li>
	<li>Automatic support for custom fonts stored in the new @Resources\Fonts folder makes distributing fonts with your skins as simple as adding the font file to the skin folder and using it in your string meters.</li>
	<li>The About dialog for Rainmeter has been improved to provide much more information about your running skins. Improvements to the display of the current values of the measures and variables in your skins makes tracking down any problems with a skin much easier.</li>
	<li>The installer for Rainmeter has been simplified to make the installation of Rainmeter just a few clicks while continuing to support installation in both 32bit and 64bit environments and normal or portable installations.</li>
	<li>There have been many additions and improvements to the localization of the Rainmeter application into 35 languages and counting.</li>
	<li>The version notification system has been improved to better alert you when there is a new release version of Rainmeter available.</li>
	<li>Rainmeter is now installed and stores user files in a way that avoids most issues with User Account Control notifications or user account privileges. Rainmeter now better supports having different setups for the different user accounts on the computer.</li>
	<li>Formulas are now supported in all numerical options and bang parameters.</li>
	<li>A new OnCloseAction setting has been added to skins, to allow you to take some action when a skin is closed.</li>
	<li>The RecycleManager plugin has been re-designed to be much more efficient and resource friendly.</li>
	<li>New options have been added to the Line and Histogram meters to make horizontal and vertical placement and direction of the information in these meters much easier and more flexible.</li>
	<li>Changes to the options in a String meter now make both horizontal and vertical alignment much easier.</li>
	<li>The Calc measure has been updated to improve conditional statements as well as improve functionality when calling other measures.</li>
	<li>Many improvements have been made to the Lua scripting environment for Rainmeter. It is now easier to communicate information between your Lua script and your skin.</li>
	<li>The development environment for creating custom plugins for Rainmeter has been virtually re-written using a new much simpler and more reliable API approach. Most of the existing standard plugins for Rainmeter now support the use of dynamic variables in the measures.</li>
	<li>Fixed "No Disk" errors with the RecycleManager plugin.</li>
	<li>Rainmeter 2.3.3 released. Rainmeter 2.4 entered beta.</li>

			<li>Some minor fixes to the About diaglog.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>New statement / option for WebParser to automatically decode html <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">Character References</a>.</p>
		<p><code>DecodeCharacterReference=0 | 1 | 2 | 3</code> (default 0)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>0: Does nothing. (default)</li>
			<li>1: Decodes both numeric character references and character entity references.</li>
			<li>2: Decodes only numeric character references.</li>
			<li>3: Decodes only character entity references.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Improved the PLAY command so it works more like a !bang does:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ButtonCommand=PLAY #SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=PLAY "#SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav"</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=!execute [PLAY #SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav]</li>
			<li>ButtonCommand=!execute [PLAY "#SKINSPATH#Beeper\Sounds\beep.wav"]</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fix an issue with the "ClickThrough" skin setting broken in an earlier beta.</li>
	<li>Major visual / interface changes to the "About" dialog. Should make this a much more valuable tool for "debugging" skins.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Win7AudioPlugin updated to version 1.6.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>New bangs Mute/Unmute</li>
			<li>Volume shows -1 when muted</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where dynamic variables would be reset to default when Windows "WorkArea" is reset by changing the screen resolution or a screensaver is activated.</li>
	<li>Minor fixes to WebParser for a memory leak and routines to interact with Rainmeter "window".</li>
	<li>Changed to allow substituting quote characters in Substitute= statements. This is done by using single quotes to surround the first part of the "find":"replace" pair. So Substitute='"':"" would remove all quotes from the text.</li>
	<li>Single and double quotes MUST be "mismatched" on the "find:replace" pairs when using single quotes as a delimiter, or the Substitute will fail. Example: Substitute='"':"None" will replace a quote with the word None. Substitute="None":'"' will replace the word None with a quote. However, Substitute='"':'None' will fail, as you can't use single quotes on both sides of the "find:replace" pairs. An easier to read example is Substitute='red':'blue', which will fail.</li>
	<li>Updated the pcre (Regular Expression) library from 6.4 to 8.10. The pcre change log is at <a href="http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt">Change Log</a></li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where certain invalid RegExp statements could crash Rainmeter.</li>
	<li>Simplified and improved the Rainstaller user interface.</li>
	<li>
		<p>Added new !bangs to change "settings" in Rainmeter.ini for current / group / all skins at once.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>!RainmeterDraggable/!RainmeterDraggableGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterKeepOnScreen/!RainmeterKeepOnScreenGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterClickThrough/!RainmeterClickThroughGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges/!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdges [parm1] (Config | *)</li>
			<li>!RainmeterSnapEdgesGroup [parm1] [GroupName]</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Parm1:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>-1 toggles the setting.</li>
			<li>0 forces the setting to off.</li>
			<li>1 forces to setting to on.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>WebParser: Fix for issue where StringIndexes from previous call to WebParser would remain even if the item no longer exists. This fixes a long standing problem with uTorrent skins for example, when the last item was removed from uTorrent but remained displayed in the skin until a refresh was done.</li>
	<li>Added MeasureName2 as an alternative to SecondaryMeasureName in Meter=Histogram.</li>
	<li>Changes to CALC measure to remove any and all restrictions on the string case of function names. Calc measures are now completely case-insensitive, with the exception of the "b/o/x" character when specifying the base of a number, this must be lower case.</li>
	<li>Added new PluginMediaKey plugin by poiru. <a href="http://rainmeter.net/cms/Plugins-MediaKey">PluginMediaKey</a>.</li>
	<li>Some minor improvements to MouseOver/MouseLeave actions.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller to close RainBrowser if it is running when a skin is installed, to eliminate a problem with open files.</li>
	<li>Fix by elestel to iTunes plugin: iTunesPlugin did not handle AboutToPromptUserToQuitEvent</li>
	<li>Added new #ROOTCONFIGPATH# variable. This will contain the path to the highest level folder under \Skins for the current config. #ROOTCONFIGPATH#Settings\UserVariables.inc can be used to have an @Include work even if you move a skin to another "suite" for instance.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the layout of the Rainmeter manual. The manual is now exclusively online. The "Help" context menu item will launch the appropriate (release or beta) version of the manual in your default web browser. The Rainmeter.chm help file is no longer included in the build or installed on your PC.</li>
	<li>Added new !RainmeterWriteKeyValue bang. !RainmeterWriteKeyValue "Section" "Key" "Value" ("FileSpec"), where "FileSpec" is an optional parameter. If FileSpec is not present, the change is automatically done in the currently running skin file. If the bang is executed from the command line, FileSpec is required. FileSpec must be either in the \Skins or %APPDATA%\Rainmeter paths. This can be used to permanently change any Key=Value setting in any .ini or .inc file. (Including Rainmeter.ini)</li>
	<li>Changes to MouseLeaveAction to make it more reliable and faster. This should eliminate having to put MouseLeaveAction in the [Rainmeter] section to ensure detection.</li>
	<li>Made the "About" dialog a bit larger by default. Other cosmetic changes to this dialog.</li>
	<li>Fixed WifiStatusPlugin so it no longer closes WLAN handle when skin is closed even if another skin is still using it</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where an invalid Format= code in a Time or Uptime measure would crash Rainmeter. Invalid formats are now written to the debug log and the measure just gracefully fails.</li>
	<li>Change to Rainstaller so that a default Rainmeter plugin will not be overwritten if an author includes it by mistake in a .rmskin file.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Rainmeter was detecting an incorrect value for %APPDATA% in a multi-user environment.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where check marks of context menu items in configs/root/variants menu are cleared if !RainmeterDeactivateConfig/!RainmeterToggleConfig is used.</li>
	<li>Minor fix to new "groups" function for configs.</li>
	<li>Added root folder of a config on the skin context menu</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where the context menu did not close when focus was given to another windows element.</li>
	<li>Many additions to the supported Windows Messages that Rainmeter will respond to, allowing 3rd-party applications to query Rainmeter for paths, currently loaded configs, etc. These changes are courtesy of JamesAC and Patrick from Dexpot.</li>
	<li>Added the Win7AudioPlugin plugin by Reiswaffle.</li>
	<li>Added the PluginVirtualDesktops plugin from Patrick at Dexpot. This will provide support for Virtual Desktop Management tools like Dexpot and VirtuaWin.</li>
	<li>Added new "version checking" functionality, with DisableVersionChecking= setting in Rainmeter.ini and on "About" dialog.</li>
	<li>Re-design of the RainBrowser GUI.</li>
	<li>Major re-design of the Rainmeter and Skins context menus</li>
	<li>Fix to Calc measure to properly allow use of numbering systems other than decimal using a prefix of 0b (binary) 0x (hex) 0o (octal) on the numbers.</li>
	<li>Added "Group=" to meters and measures in skins, and in Rainmeter.ini to support configs. This allows many !bangs to operate on multiple entities at once without multiple !bang statements.</li>
	<li>Major improvement to "logging" in Rainmeter, including new context menu support.</li>
	<li>Addition of support for multiple monitors when using DesktopWorkArea. This change is courtesy of user Jott.</li>
	<li>Addtion of "ToolTip" functionality, so meters can have standard Windows tooltips when hovered over.</li>
	<li>Improvement to image quality when scaling images</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rainmeter 1.2 <small>(r440)</small></h2>
<h3>24 June, 2010</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Major improvements to how Rainmeter works with multiple monitors.</li>
	<li>New WebParser settting "DownloadFile=" to allow local storage and naming of downloaded images.</li>
	<li>New !Bang - !RainmeterRefreshApp. Allows full Rainmeter refresh from a skin or command line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Issue where DynamicVariables=1 disabled UpdateDivider.</li>
	<li>FIXED: LineColor did not use the values of Dynamic Variables in Meter=Line.</li>
	<li>FIXED: Inconsistent numerical value via DynamicVariables ( issue 130 )</li>
	<li>FIXED: Problem with WebParser and "local files" with Cyrillic chars in the path. (issue 139)</li>
	<li>The coded character set of the logfile is changed to UTF-8. (ccs=UTF-8) <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb(VS.80).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>
	<li>"MS Shell Dlg 2" is now used for the ABOUT dialog box. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282187">msdn.microsoft.com</a></li>
	<li>FIXED: Invalid error message box when DynamicVariables is 1 and FontSize is 0. (issue 126)</li>
	<li>FIXED: Virtual Bytes usage for an x64 process with perfmon plugin does not display value greater than 4 GB ( issue 113 )</li>
	<li>FIXED: A numeric value greater than 32bit can be now displayed when NumOfDecimals is 0 in Meter=STRING.</li>

	<li>Added StringCase function to Meter=String. StringCase=[NONE | UPPER | LOWER | PROPER]</li>
	<li>Change !RainmeterSetVariable to accept formulas as a parameter. Formulas must be enclosed in parentheses with the entire parameter enclosed in quotes if there are spaces in the formula: !RainmeterSetVariable VarName "(#SCREENAREAWIDTH# - 50)"</li>
	<li>Changed the code to enable the use of "On Desktop" (AlwaysOnTop=-2) Z-Position for skins under Vista and Win7.</li>

	<li>Added Rainmeter version information to the right click (Properties / Details) menu for Rainmeter.exe.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with Rainmeter properly using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) network shared drives / folders, such as "\\SERVER".</li>
	<li>Fixed a small bug in @Include routines that impacted some @Inlcude and MeterStyle combinations.</li>
	<li>The RANDOM math function was case sensitive, requiring "Random" only. Now case insensitive.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where a very high Update rate could cause problems closing a skin.</li>
	<li>Changed the HighBound parameter for RANDOM to return up to and including the number in HighBound instead of just up to.</li>
	<li>Added #CRLF# as a built-in variable to allow putting a carriage return / line feed in a string meter.</li>
	<li>Changed the undocumented LG (logarithm) function to be LOG and added to the manual.</li>
