<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With this tutorial, we are going to cover several things.  First, we are going to introduce two new measure and two new meter types, as well as some new options for controlling how they work.  We will also touch on the use of <a href="http://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/update-guide">UpdateDivider</a> on measures to control the performance of a skin, and will explore using <a href="!variables">Variables</a> to set, use and change values shared by measures and meters.</p>

<p>There is a lot going on in this skin, so let's explore the end-result a bit so you can get a sense of where we are going as we work through it. First, let's take a look at the final skin.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">What we are going to do is measure the percent usage of the CPU, and the space on a couple of hard drives.  Then we are going to create some circular meters showing the usage with <a href="!meters/roundline">Roundline</a> meters.  We are going to monitor the CPU with a <a href="!meters/line">Line</a> meter, and display some information about the space on your hard drives.  You only see one hard drive in that image? We will get to that...</p>
