<p>A <strong>meter</strong> is an object that defines a visual element that is displayed in a <a href="/manual/skins">skin</a>. Meters are one of the two major kinds of objects in a skin, along with <a href="/manual/measures">measures</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>A meter does not have a <a href="/manual/measures#Values">"value"</a> in the way that measures do. Some meters are used to display or respond to informational values in two ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>A meter can be <a href="/manual/meters/general-options#MeasureName">bound to a measure</a>. In this way, the meter will automatically display the value in a way that is appropriate for the type of meter. For example, a <a href="/manual/meters/string">string</a> meter would display the <a href="/manual/measures#Values">string value</a> of a measure as a block of text, while a <a href="/manual/meters/bar">bar</a> meter would display the same measure's number value as a <a href="/manual/measures#Percentage">percentage</a> of its maximum value. Some meter types must be bound to a specific measure; on others, binding is optional.</p></li>
	<li><p>A meter can use <a href="/manual/variables">variables</a> in any option. This includes <a href="/manual/variables/section-variables">section variables</a>, which provide an alternative way of using measure values. <a href="/manual/variables#DynamicVariables">Dynamic variables</a> are allowed in all options on all meters (other than the <code>Meter</code> option).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not all meters are used to display information. Some are used to create static elements, such as background images, frames and labels. Specific options and requirements for each meter type are detailed in their individual articles.</p>

<h2 id="Format">Format</h2>

<p>A meter is written as a <a href="/manual/skins#Format">section</a> in the skin. All meters use the <code>Meter</code> option to define the section as a specific type of meter. Most other meter options depend on the type, but there are some <a href="/manual/meters/general-options">general options</a> that are valid in many or all meters.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a complete working meter:</p>

{% highlight ini %}
[MyMeter]
Meter=String
Text=Hello, world!
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="Positions">Positions</h2>

<p>A meter has a certain <strong>position</strong>, which is given by its <a href="/manual/meters/general-options#XY">X and Y options</a>, and <strong>dimensions</strong>, which are given by its <a href="/manual/meters/general-options#WH">W and H options</a>. This means that every meter is actually bounded by a rectangular block of pixels, even though it may have a <a href"/manual/meters/general-options/#SolidColor">transparent background</a> and therefore appear to be "free-floating."</p>

<p>Meters are positioned within the <a href="/manual/skin">skin window</a>. This means that when the skin is moved, its meters move with it. It also means that meter positions are given relative to the top-left corner of the skin, rather than the desktop. For example, a meter with the option <code>X=15</code> starts 15 pixels from the left edge of the skin.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the <strong>skin window</strong> are determined by the positions and dimensions of all meters when the skin is loaded. If the skin has <a href="/manual/skins/rainmeter-section#DynamicWindowSize">DynamicWindowSize</a> enabled, the window will be "pushed" outward if meters are moved rightward or downward or expand in width or height. However, meters that move leftward beyond <code>X=0</code>, or upward beyond <code>Y=0</code>, will appear either "cut off" or completely invisible. There is no technical limit to the size of the skin window, but, practically speaking, skins should be made to fit within the current <a href="/manual/variables/built-in-variables#WORKAREAXYWH">desktop work area</a>.</p>

<div class="exampleprev" style="max-width: 480px;">
	<img src="/img/meters/index-positions-example.png" />
	<p>Left: a skin with a single meter that appears to be "free-floating." Right: the same skin with colored backgrounds added, showing how the meter (purple) is actually positioned inside the skin window (green) and "pushes" the window boundaries to the lower-right.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Order">Order</h2>

<p>The order of meters in the skin code is important in two ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>"Z" position.</strong> Meters are drawn in order. Later meters appear "on top of" or "in front of" earlier meters. This means that, for example, a background <a href="/manual/meters/image">image</a> that appears behind all other meters must be the first meter that appears in the skin code.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Relative positions.</strong> A meter's <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code> position may be set <a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#XY">"relative"</a> to the position of the previous meter. This is useful for groups of meters that follow a common pattern, such as lists, panels or menu items.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Styles">Styles</h2>

<p>Meters can use options from other meters. Using <a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a>, one meter may <strong>inherit</strong> all options from one or more "parent" meters. The only options that cannot be inherited are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#Meter">Meter</a>. The meter type must be explicitly set in order to identify a section as a meter.</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a> itself. This means that meter styles cannot be inherited through more than one generation. In other words, they cannot have "grandparents."</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If an option is given on both the parent meter and the child meter, the child's setting overrides the parent. If multiple parents are given, separated by pipes (<code>|</code>), options on later parents override those on earlier parents.</p>

<p>Inherited options are used just as if they were explicitly written in the child meter. For example, if the <a href="/manual/variables/built-in-variables#CURRENTSECTION">#CURRENTSECTION#</a> variable is used in an inherited option, it resolves as the name of the child meter, not the parent. Similarly, if a <a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#XY">relative position</a> is used, such as <code>X=5R</code>, the meter immediately previous to the child meter is used, not the parent's.</p>

<p>Meters may inherit options from sections that are not meters. A skin section of any name<sup>1</sup> that does not have the <code>Meter</code> or <code>Measure</code> options is informally called a <strong>style</strong>. A style section is completely ignored by Rainmeter unless it is referenced in the <code>MeterStyle</code> option of a meter. Options that are not valid for the child meter are also simply ignored, which means that the parent and child can be different types.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Aside from [Rainmeter] and [Variables], which are <a href="/manual/skins/#Format">reserved for special purposes</a>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

{% highlight ini %}
[MyFirstParent]
Meter=String
Text=I'm a parent!
X=10
FontColor=255,0,0
FontFace=Segoe UI
FontSize=15
AntiAlias=1
StringStyle=Bold

[MySecondParent]
StringStyle=Italic
FontColor=0,255,0

[MyChild]
Meter=String
MeterStyle=MyFirstParentMeter | MySecondParentMeter
FontColor=0,0,255
{% endhighlight %}

<p><em>MyChild</em> inherits all options from the <em>MyFirstParent</em> meter and the <em>MySecondParent</em> style. This means it is displayed with all of the same font, color, size and other options given for those sections. The second parent's <code>StringStyle</code> option overrides the first parent's, which means the child meter displays italic text. Likewise, the child meter's <code>FontColor</code> option overrides both parents', so the text displays with a color of <code>0,0,255</code> (blue).</p>
