<p>Plugins are dynamic link library (.dll) programs specifically written to provide additional functionality not built into Rainmeter.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Plugins are used with a <a href="!measures/plugin">Plugin measure</a> in the skin. All of the <a href="!measures/general-options">general measure options</a> are valid with the measure, as well as additional options which are specific to each plugin.</p>

<p>Click on any of the plugins listed to learn more about the purpose and options for each.</p>

<h2 id="Custom">Custom Plugins</h2>
<p>3rd-party plugins developed for Rainmeter but not included with the installation may be used. Normally these would be distributed with a skin and installed using the <a href="!installing-skins">Rainmeter Skin Installer</a>, but may be manually installed by placing the .dll file in the <code>Plugins</code> folder under the <a href="!variables/built-in-variables#SETTINGSPATH">settings path</a> for the Rainmeter installation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Any 3rd-party plugin .dll must have been compiled for the same 32bit or 64bit architecture as the version of Rainmeter it is used with.</p>

<p>Those interested in creating 3rd-party plugins for Rainmeter can find more information and source code templates for both C++ and C# at <a href="http://docs.rainmeter.net/developers">Developers</a>.</p>
