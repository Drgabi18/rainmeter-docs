<p>Rainmeter can be controlled using several user interface tools built into the application.  Choose one of the items to see details on how they are used to operate the application, install, load and manage skins, monitor and debug during skin editing, and save and load the current skin layout and settings.</p>

<h3><a href="/manual/user-interface/manage">Manage</a></h3>
<p>The primary management tool for Rainmeter.  Load and unload skins, control settings for the application and skins, load and save layouts and more.</p>

<h3><a href="/manual/user-interface/about">About</a></h3>
<p>Much more than the usual simple About dialog in applictions, the About dialog in Rainmeter provides powerful tools for monitoring the current status of the application and skins.  Monitor the log file for information and errors, watch current values of variables and measures for running skins, and view the status and version of the application and plugins.</p>

<h3><a href="/manual/user-interface/context-menus">Context Menus</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the Manage dialog, Rainmeter can be completely controlled from context menu items available by right-clicking the application's notification area (system tray) icon or an individual skin on the screen.</p>
