<h2 id="SystemRequirements">System Requirements</h2>

<p>Rainmeter requires <b>Windows XP</b> or above. Some specific features require Windows Vista or above. The same installer may be used on either <b>32-bit or 64-bit</b> systems, and all skins and features are compatible with both architectures.</p>

<p>Rainmeter is not available for non-Windows systems, including Mac OS and Linux, and there are no plans to support these operating systems.</p>

<h2 id="Download">Download</h2>

<p>Start by downloading the Rainmeter installer from the <a href="http://rainmeter.net">Rainmeter.net</a>.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Rainmeter available: the <b>final</b> release of the current version, and the <b>beta</b> release of the next version. Betas are released weekly, and final versions are released every few months. Despite the "beta" label, every release of Rainmeter is stable and backwards-compatible with previous versions. The only difference is that beta features may (rarely) be changed or removed before the next version becomes final.</p>

<p>We recommend the beta version for most users who want to get the latest features and bug fixes. However, if you do not want to risk using a beta feature that may not work the same in a future release, use the final version instead.</p>

<p>To install Rainmeter, run the installer program that you downloaded, and follow the instructions. (See <a href="!installing-rainmeter">Installing Rainmeter</a> if you need more detailed instructions, including steps for installing Rainmeter as a portable application.)</p>

<p>Rainmeter will run automatically after it has been installed.</p>
