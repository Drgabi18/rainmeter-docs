<h3>Using Update, UpdateDivider and UpdateRate</h3>

<p>The <a href="/manual/skins/rainmeter-section#Update">Update</a> option in the [Rainmeter] section controls how often in milliseconds a skin should update the measures and meters. The <a href="/manual/measures/general-options/#UpdateDivider">UpdateDivider</a> option on a <a href="/manual/meters/general-options/#UpdateDivider">meter</a> or a <a href="/manual/measures/general-options/#UpdateDivider">measure</a> allows you multiply the update interval for that specific meter or measure. By applying UpdateDivider correctly, it is possible to make your skins more efficient.</p>

<p>For example, <code>UpdateDivider=5</code> on a measure would cause that meter to update only on every 5th update cycle. When <code>Update=1000</code>, the measure will update every (1000 x 5) milliseconds, which is equal to every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>By default, <code>Update=1000</code> and <code>UpdateDivider=1</code>. The general formula for calculating the update interval of a measure or a meter in seconds is as follows: (Update x UpdateDivider / 1000).</p>

<p>In the example below, the skin's update interval is set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Since [MeasureCPU] does not have <code>UpdateDivider</code> set, it will default to 1. As a result, [MeasureCPU] will update once every second.</p>

<p>In contrast, [MeasureUser] has <code>UpdateDivider=3600</code>, as the user name is unlikely to change that often. As a result, [MeasureUser] will update once every 3600 seconds (i.e. once every hour).</p>

<p>[MeasureTotalC] has <code>UpdateDivider=-1</code> set. When UpdateDivider is a negative number, the measure will update only once (when the skin is loaded or refreshed). Because [MeasureTotalC] measures the total space of the drive (which will not change), the it is safe to measure it only once.</p>

``` ini
[Rainmeter]
Update=1000

[MeasureCPU]
Measure=CPU

[MeasureUser]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=SysInfo
SysInfoType=USER_NAME
UpdateDivider=3600

[MeasureTotalC]
Measure=FreeDiskSpace
Drive=C:
Total=1
UpdateDivider=-1
```

<h3>What about UpdateRate?</h3>

<p>UpdateDivider is an option available to <em>all</em> meters and measures. <a href="/manual/plugins/webparser#UpdateRate">UpdateRate</a>, on the other hand, is only available with the WebParser and Ping plugins. For the purpose of this example, let us use a plugin measure using WebParser.</p>

<p>UpdateRate essentially states how often the WebParser should connect to the internet to download the specified URL. The general formula for this is in seconds is as follows: (Update x UpdateDivider x UpdateRate / 1000).</p>

<p>In the example below, [MeasureMailCount] does not have <code>UpdateDivider</code>. As a result, UpdateDivider will default to 1.</p>

<p>Since [MeasureMailCount] has <code>UpdateRate=1200</code> set, we can calculate that WebParser will download the page every 1200 seconds (or every 20 minutes).</p>

``` ini
[MeasureMailCount]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=https://username:pasword@gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom
RegExp="(?siU)<fullcount>(.*)</fullcount>"
StringIndex=1
UpdateRate=1200
```

<p>Since WebParser connects to the internet, it is important to have a high enough "download interval". If you try to download a page too often (e.g. every second), you may end up causing a high load on the target site, which ultimately may cause the site to block all access from your computer.</p>
