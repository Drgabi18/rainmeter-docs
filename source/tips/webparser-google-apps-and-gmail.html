<p><em>tip by jackfrost.</em></p>

<p>If you have a Google Apps account associated with your GMail, and you want to use it in a GMail skin, use the following URL in the WebParser measure:</p>
``` ini
URL=https://GMailID%40Domain.com:GMailPassword@mail.google.com/a/Domain.com/feed/atom/
```

<p>Make sure that the items GMailID, Domain.com, and GMailPassword are replaced with your own credentials.</p>

<p>The "%40" string is the encoded form of "@" to avoid a problem where WebParser improperly formats the URL.</p>
