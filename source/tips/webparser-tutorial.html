title: 'WebParser Tutorial'

<p>This tutorial is meant to shed some light on using the <a href="/manual/measures/webparser/">WebParser measure</a> in Rainmeter to retrieve information from a website for use in your skins. A lot of us have used WebParser to get RSS feeds or other data from websites, but often by using or tweaking existing code, and without really understanding how it works.

<h2>WebParser overview</h2>

<p>WebParser is a measure that is used to connect to some resource, normally a web site on the internet, read the raw HTML output that the site returns, and parse information from that output to use in <a href="/manual/meters/">meters</a> in your skin.</p>

<p>When we say <em>parse</em> in this context, what we mean is to <em>search</em> the output for some text strings. Finding those strings will position you in the output at a point where you want some information. Then you <em>capture</em> that information, and display the results in meters.</p>

<p>The basic format of a WebParser skin is:</p>

``` ini
[MeasureParent]
Measure=WebParser
URL=https://SomeSite.com
RegExp=(?siU)<item>(.*)</item>.*<item>(.*)</item>

[MeasureChild1]
Measure=WebParser
URL=[MeasureParent]
StringIndex=1

[MeasureChild2]
Measure=WebParser
URL=[MeasureParent]
StringIndex=2

[MeterChild1]
Meter=String
MeasureName=MeasureChild1

[MeterChild2]
Meter=String
MeasureName=MeasureChild2
```

<p>It is important right off to understand that WebParser works with a "parent / child" approach.  What happens is that the parent measure connects to the site with the <a href="/manual/measures/webparser/#URL">URL</a>, and uses the <a href="/manual/measures/webparser/#RegExp">RegExp</a> option to capture some information with one or more instances of <code>(.*)</code>. The captured information is held by WebParser, and is individually referenced by child measures with the <a href="/manual/measures/webparser/#StringIndex">StringIndex</a> numbers.  Each <code>(.*)</code> captures some information and creates a StringIndex.

<h2>The RegExp option</h2>

<p>Now let's spend a minute talking about the key part of the code, that <code>RegExp</code> option. As we saw above, WebParser uses a <em>regular expression</em> to search for the bits of information you want to retrieve, and return them in one or more <code>StringIndex</code> values on the measure.</p>

<p>So how do we build one of these mysterious <code>RegExp</code> statements in Rainmeter? Let me use a template showing the format in simple terms:<p>

<p><code>RegExp=(?siU)Search1(.*)Search2.*</code></p>

<p>So enclosed in quotes, you have:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>(?siU)</b> - Which is an "options modifier" for the regular expression, telling it how you want it to behave.</li>
	<li><b>Search1</b> - Which will be some text you will search on to get you right up to the data you want.</li>
	<li><b>(.*)</b> - The data you want returned in the array to use in your skin. The parentheses tell it to "capture" everything between "Search1" and "Search2". In our examples we are using the string ".*" in our captures, which simply means "." (any character) and "*" (zero or more of them).</li>
	<li><b>Search2</b> - Use this to tell RegExp what to look for to know it's time to "stop" capturing information.</li>
	<li><b> .*</b> - This will contain data from the website which is between this set of search/return parameters and the next one. It will not be returned as you did not enclose the .* in parentheses, and will not use a StringIndex number. This is used to "skip" to the next search you want to do.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What is this (?siU) stuff?</b></p>

<p>The (?siU) starts with the <code>?</code> character to tell the regular expression that what follows inside the parentheses are directives for the overall expression.</p>

<p>the "s" tells RegExp to ignore line breaks and tabs when doing a search. For example, if you search for "Every good boy deserves favor" and it is split on two lines in the output, it will still match.</p>

<p>The "i" tells the search to be "case insensitive". Matches will work on both upper and lower case.</p>

<p>The "U" tells RegExp to be "ungreedy", meaning that it will return only the first instance of the match on the search string.</p>

<p>These directives are not required, but you will find that they are generally the right way to go when using WebParser in Rainmeter, and you will want to use "(?siU)" to start your RegExp most of the time.</p>

<h3>A quick example:</h3>

<p>You have a web page you want to get the "title" tag from. Here is the RegExp you would use:</p>

<p><code>RegExp=(?siU)&lt;title&gt;(.*)&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>

<p>So we have told RegExp to search for the text "&lt;title&gt;" then capture <code>(.*)</code> everything after it in StringIndex 1 of the measure until it sees "&lt;/title&gt;", where it will stop capturing.</p>

<p>This guide is meant to be simple and very "WebParser" focused. It is NOT a full-blown guide to <em>regular expressions</em>. I would encourage you to either now or later open up a browser tab/window here: <a href="/manual/skins/option-types/#RegExp" target="_blank">Regular expression options</a> and check out the various references and guides available.</p>

<h2>Our tutorial skin</h2>

<p>So what we are going to do today is parse a website <a href="https://www.ipaddress.my/" target="blank">https://www.ipaddress.my/</a> to get our IP and location information to use in a skin. Click that link now if you want to open the page in a new tab/window.</p>

<p>Here is what the web page we are going to parse looks like, with the information we are going to extract numbered:</p>

</div>

<h2>Let's Build It</h2>

<h2>The parent Webparser measure</h2>

<p>First, let's get our skin started, and use an option on our first parent WebParser measure to get the raw HTML output from the site into a text file we can use for reference.</p>

``` ini
[Rainmeter]
Update=1000
AccurateText=1
DynamicWindowSize=1

[MeasureSite]
Measure=WebParser
URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/
RegExp=
Debug=2

[MeterDummy]
Meter=String
```
<p>As you can see, we don't even have a <code>RegExp</code> option filled in yet, and only one dummy meter. We just want to use that <code>Debug=2</code> option on the measure, then save and load the skin.</p>

<p>When <a href="/manual/measures/webparser/#Debug">Debug=2</a> is used, WebParser will connect to the site, and download the HTML that is returned into a text file. That file will be called <em>WebParserDump.txt</em> and will be in the same folder with the skin .ini file. Open that file in a text editor, so you have it to work with as we create our measures.</p>

<p><em>Once you have a copy of the site output in WebParserDump.txt, you should remove that <code>Debug=2</code> option and save your skin.</em></p>

<p>Now let's look at the first bit of information we want to retrieve.</p>

<p>First we will get the flag image that is displayed centered near the top of the page.</p>

<p>Open up WebParserDump.txt (the saved output from the website) and search for the location where the site is storing these flag images:</p>

``` html
		<img src="/images/flags/us.png" border="0" height="48" width="48" alt="United States of America flag" align="absMiddle" /> </li>
```

<p>If we search for <code>/images/flags/</code>, it will take us to the right place. What we want is the name of the file that follows <code>/images/flags/</code>. In this example, <code>us.png</code>.</p>

<p>Let's start building our <code>RegExp</code> option:</p>

``` html
			MeasureSite]
			Measure=Plugin
			Plugin=WebParser
			URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/
			RegExp=(?siU)<img src="/images/flags/(.*)"
			UpdateRate=3600
```

<p>The important options are:</p>

<p><b>URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/</b> - The URL to the website. It can be set as a variable in the [Variables] section to make it easier to find and change if you want.</p>

<p><b>RegExp=(?siU)&ltimg src="/images/flags/(.*)"</b> - Ah, the meat and potatoes...</p>

<p>You are telling RegExp to:</p>

<p>Use the (?siU) expression directives, (described earlier) search for <code>&ltimg src="/images/flags/</code> and capture everything to a StringIndex <code>(.*)</code> until it sees <code>"</code>, where it will stop.</p>

<p>So if we look again at our output in WebParserDump.txt </p>

``` html
		<img src="/images/flags/us.png" border="0" height="48" width="48" alt="United States of America flag" align="absMiddle" /> </li>
```

<p>You can see that we will return <code>us.png</code> in StringIndex 1</p>

<p><b>UpdateRate=3600</b> - We want to check the website at a rate 3600 times the value in the "Update=" parameter in the "Rainmeter" section. As this defaults to "1000" or once every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) we will be running WebParser every 3600 seconds or 60 minutes. This is plenty often, as your IP information doesn't change much and you don't want to "spam" the website with requests. You may well find yourself blocked...</p>

<h2>The first child measure</h2>

<p>Then, we build a "child" measure, to grab that information from StringIndex 1 of the "parent" measure.</p>

<p>What we really want is not the file name of the flag image, but the image itself. WebParser can easily do this.</p>

<p>As long as the value from the parent measure that is returned in the StringIndex number is the URL to an image file, you can simply add the <code>Download=1</code> option to the child measure, and the image will be downloaded. The value of the child measure will then be the full <em>local</em> path to the file in the Windows TEMP folder Rainmeter will create.</p>

<p>However, wait.. the value "us.png" that is returned is not a full URL to the image. There is also a "relative path" to the image on the remote server. That's ok, we can still get the image.</p>

<h3>Creating the child measure for the the first StringIndex, the flag image value</h3>

``` ini
[MeasureFlagImage]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/images/flags/[MeasureSite]
StringIndex=1
Download=1
```

<p>What we are doing is appending the first part of the URL, the one we used on the parent measure to the beginning of the <code>URL</code> option, followed by the relative path that flag images are stored in on the site, which is <code>/images/flags/</code> and a reference to [MeasureSite] and the <code>StringIndex=2</code> option. Then we add <code>Download=1</code> and that full URL of <code>https://www.ipaddress.my/images/flags/us.png</code> will be used to retrieve the image file.</p>

<p>The value of the child measure will in my case be:</p>

<p><code>C:\Users\Jeffrey\AppData\Local\Temp\Rainmeter-Cache\us.png</code></p>

<p>Which we can use in an Image meter later to display it.</p>

<h3>Testing as we go</h3>

<p>You should open (and pretty much leave open while building your skin) the <a href="/manual/user-interface/about/#SkinsTab">About / Skins</a> dialog.  In this panel you can see the values of your measures as you save and refresh your skin. You will be able to tell at a glance whether you are getting the values you expect from your <code>RegExp</code>.  If there are problems, be sure to check the <a href="/manual/user-interface/about/#LogTab">About / Log</a> panel for any error messages.</p>

<div class="exampleprev">
<a href="/tips/img/webparser-tutorial/WebParserAbout1.jpg" data-fancybox><img src="/tips/img/webparser-tutorial/WebParserAbout1.jpg"></a>
</div>

<h2>The second child measure</h2>

<p>Now let's get the next bit of information we want from the website. (Remember, the RegExp reads the website in order from top to bottom, so you need to use the correct order in the "RegExp=" statement. You can display the information in any order you want on your skin however.)</p>

<p>The next information in the WebParserDump file that we want is the IP address for your computer that the site detects:</p>

``` html
<tr>
<td width="40%">IP Address:</td>
<td width="60%"><a href="https://www.ip2location.com/demo/68.100.86.32" target="_blank">68.100.86.32</a></td>
</tr>
```

<p>So we want to add to our "RegExp=" statement, search for th IP address, and return the result in the next StringIndex on the parent measure:</p>

``` ini
[MeasureSite]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/
RegExp=(?siU)<img src="/images/flags/(.*)".*<td width="40%">IP Address:</td>.*target="_blank">(.*)<
UpdateRate=3600
```

<p>So after the first pair of start/stop searches we already did, we are adding:</p>

<p><code>.*&lttd width="40%"&gtIP Address:&lt/td&gt.*target="_blank"&gt(.*)&lt</code></p>

<p>This will tell RegExp to skip everything until it finds <code>&lttd width="40%"&gtIP Address:&lt/td&gt.*target="_blank"&gt</code> and then capture everything until it sees <code>&lt</code> and put it in <code>StringIndex=2</code>. The result in my example will be <code>68.100.86.32</code>.</p>

<h3>Creating the child measure for the the second StringIndex, the IP address value</h3>

``` ini
			[MeasureIP]
			Measure=Plugin
			Plugin=WebParser
			URL=[MeasureSite]
			StringIndex=2
```

<h2>The third child measure</h2>

<p>Now we want to get the name of the "City":</p>

``` html
<tr>
<td>City:</td>
<td>Fairfax</td>
</tr>
```

<p>So we want to add to our "RegExp=" statement, search for the city name, and return the result in the next StringIndex on the parent measure:</p>

``` ini
[MeasureSite]
Measure=WebParser
URL=https://www.geoiptool.com/
RegExp=(?siU)<img src="/images/flags/(.*)".*<td width="40%">IP Address:</td>.*target="_blank">(.*)<.*<td>City:</td>.*<td>(.*)</td>
```

<p>So after the start/stop searches we already had on the RegExp option, we are adding:</p>

<p><code>.*&lttd&gtCity:&lt/td&gt.*&lttd&gt(.*)&lt/td&gt</code></p>

<p>This will tell RegExp to skip everything until it sees <code>&lttd&gtCity:&lt/td&gt.*&lttd&gt</code> then capture everything until it sees <code>&lt/td&gt</code> and put it in <code>StringIndex=3</code>. The result in my example will be <code>Fairfax</code>.</p>

<h3>Creating the child measure for the the third StringIndex, the city name value</h3>

``` ini
			[MeasureCity]
			Measure=Plugin
			Plugin=WebParser
			URL=[MeasureSite]
			StringIndex=3
```

<h3>And so on...</h3>

<p>Carry on like that until you have retrieved all the data you want from the website. Here is the final parent measure with the completed RegExp:</p>

``` ini
[MeasureSite]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=https://www.ipaddress.my/
RegExp=(?siU)<img src="/images/flags/(.*)".*<td width="40%">IP Address:</td>.*target="_blank">(.*)<.*<td>City:</td>.*<td>(.*)</td>.*<td>Country:</td>.*target="_blank">(.*)<.*<td>State:</td>.*<td>(.*)</td>.*<td>Latitude:</td>.*<td>(.*)</td>.*<td>Longitude:</td>.*<td>(.*)</td>
UpdateRate=3600
```

<p>and the rest of the child measures:</p>


``` ini
[MeasureCountryName]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureSite]
StringIndex=4
Substitute="	":"","#CRLF#":""

[MeasureRegion]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureSite]
StringIndex=5

[MeasureLatitude]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureSite]
StringIndex=6

[MeasureLongitude]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureSite]
StringIndex=7
```

<div class="exampleprev">

</div>

<h2>The meters</h2>

<p>Once you have all the information captured by the parent measure and individually retrieved by the child measures, you can use the values of those measures in meters any way you like.</p>

<p>We won't go into any explanation of how the meters work in this guide, but if you use this code:</p>
