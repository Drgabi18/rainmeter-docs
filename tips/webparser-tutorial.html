<!--{% comment %}--><base href="../"><script src="js/_local.js"></script><!--{% endcomment %}-->

<p>This little tutorial is meant to shed some light on using the WebParser.dll plugin in Rainmeter to retrieve information from a website for use in your skins. A lot of us have used WebParser to get RSS feeds or other data from websites, but often by using/tweaking other folk's code and without really understanding how it works or how to create one of those ridiculous <code>RegExp</code> statements which are the core of how you parse a web page to extract information.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be exhaustive, nor do I go into the formats of XML files or how they are used in RSS feeds. Suffice it to say though, that once you know how to parse a web page in general, parsing RSS feeds will be a breeze as they follow a much more predictable pattern.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>First, let's get a .rmskin file with everything you will need for this tutorial. Simply download and run this file to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/downloads/rainmeter/rainmeter-docs/WebParserGuide_1.0.rmskin">Download HERE</a></p>
<p>You may also want to click here: <a href="/manual/plugins/webparser" target="_blank">Manual - WebParser</a> so we have the full manual for WebParser as a reference as we go along.</p>

<h3>RegExp</h3>

<p>Now let's spend a minute talking about the key part of the code, the <code>RegExp</code> option. WebParser uses this "regular expression" to search for the bits of information you want to retrieve, and return them in one or more <code>StringIndex</code> values on the measure.</p>

<p>So how do we build one of these mysterious <code>RegExp</code> statements in Rainmeter? Let me use a template showing the format in simple terms:<p>
<code>RegExp="(?siU)Search1(.*)Search2.*"</code>
<p>So enclosed in quotes, you have:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>(?siU)</strong> - Which is an "options modifier" for the regular expression, telling it how you want it to behave.</li>
	<li><strong>Search1</strong> - Which will be some text you will search on to get you right up to the data you want.</li>
	<li><strong>(.*)</strong> - The data you want returned in the array to use in your skin. The parentheses tell it to "capture" everything between "Search1" and "Search2".  In our examples we are using the string ".*" in our captures, which simply means "." (any character) and "*" (zero or more of them).</li>
	<li><strong>Search2</strong> - Use this to tell RegExp what to look for to know it's time to "stop" capturing information.</li>
	<li><strong> .*</strong> - This will contain data from the website which is between this set of search/return parameters and the next one. It will not be returned as you did not enclose the .* in parentheses, and will not use a StringIndex number.  This is used to "skip" to the next search you want to do.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is this ?siU stuff?</strong></p>
<p>The "?s" tells RegExp to ignore "line breaks" when doing a search. That way if you search for "Every good boy deserves favor" and it is split on two lines in the output, it will still match.</p>
<p>The "i" tells the search to be "case insensitive". Matches will work on both upper and lower case.</p>
<p>The "U" tells RegExp to be "ungreedy", meaning that it will return only the first instance of the match on the search string.</p>
<p>These modifiers are not required, but you will find that they are generally the right way to go when using WebParser in Rainmeter, and you will want to use "(?siU)" to start your RegExp most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>A quick example:</strong></p>
<p>You have a web page you want to get the "TITLE" tag from. Here is the RegExp you would use:</p>
<p><code>RegExp="(?siU)&lt;TITLE&gt;(.*)&lt;/TITLE&gt;"</code></p>
<p>So we have told RegExp to search for the text "&lt;TITLE&gt;" then return everything after it in StringIndex 1 (the first capture) of the measure until it sees "&lt;/TITLE&gt;", where it will stop.</p>
<p>This guide is meant to be simple and very "WebParser" focused.  It is NOT a full-blown guide to "Regular Expressions".  I would encourage you however to either now or later on open up a browser tab/window here: <a href="http://perlcity.com/perl-regular-expressions.html" target="_blank">Perl Regular Expressions</a> and take a look at the full range of possibilities for regular expressions.  It is a VERY powerful tool.</p>

<h3>Our Example Skin</h3>
<p>So what we are going to do today is parse a website <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation" target="blank">http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation</a> to get our IP and location information to use in a skin. Click that link now if you want to open the page in a new tab/window.</p>

<p>Here is what the web page we are going to parse looks like:</p>
<div class="exampleprev">
<a rel="lightbox" href="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage01.jpg"><img src="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage01.jpg" width="600"/></a>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>Here is the information we are going to extract from it (highlighted):</p>
<div class="exampleprev">
<img src="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage03.jpg" width="400"/>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>Here is the final skin we will create: (I have kept the skin simple as the purpose is to learn WebParser, not skinning in general)</p>
<div class="exampleprev">
<img src="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage02.jpg" width="300"/>
</div>

<h3>Let's Build It</h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to go to the web page in your browser, right-click, choose "View Page Source", copy everything, paste it into a text editor and save the output/source of the web page to a text file. (Save it as something like Webpage<strong>.txt</strong> and not .html, so you can easily use a text editor to work with it in a bit.)</p>

<p>Let's start by looking at the first bit of information we want to retrieve.</p>
<div class="exampleprev">
<img src="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage03.jpg" width="400"/>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>We want to start by getting our IP address. On the web page, it is near the top of the area with all the information we want, with a label "IP Address to locate:"</p>
<p>Open up Webpage.txt (the saved output from the website) and search for that label. You will find a section of the html which looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;form method="POST" action="IpLocator.htm?GetLocation"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="cid" value="0"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="c" value="0"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="Template" value="iplocator.htm"&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15"
     value="72.205.26.142"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
 &lt;/h2&gt;
</pre><br>

<p><em>I hope I don't have to say that the actual IP address will be different for you than what is in this guide. If that comes as a surprise to you, please exit your browser now and uninstall Rainmeter.  Then restart your browser and go here: <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">LOLCATS</a></em>
</p>

<p>So let's start building our measures, and a sample meter showing the output.</p>
<p><strong>First, we build the "parent" measure, containing the StringIndexes:</strong><br>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeasureWebSite]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
UpdateRate=1800
Url="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation"
RegExp="(?siU)&lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15" value="(.*)"&gt;.*"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>What we are telling WebParser is:</p>
<p><strong>UpdateRate=1800</strong> - We want to check the website at a rate 1800 times the value in the "Update=" parameter in the "Rainmeter" section. As this defaults to "1000" or once every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) we will be running WebParser every 1800 seconds or 30 minutes. This is plenty often, you could even check every hour or more as your IP information doesn't change much and you don't want to "spam" the website with requests. You may well find yourself blocked...</p>
<p><strong>Url="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation"</strong> - The URL to the website. It can be set as a variable in the "VARIABLES" section to make it easier to find and change if you want.>/p>
<p><strong>RegExp="(?siU)&lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15" value="(.*)"&gt;"</strong> - Ah, the meat and potatoes...</p>
<p>You are telling RegExp to:</p>
<p>Use the (?siU) command parameters, (described earlier) search for IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15" value=" and capture to a StringIndex everything until it sees "&gt; where it will stop.</p>
<p>So if we look again at our output in Webpage.txt </p>
<pre>
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;form method="POST" action="IpLocator.htm?GetLocation"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="cid" value="0"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="c" value="0"&gt;
 &lt;input type="hidden" name="Template" value="iplocator.htm"&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15"
     value="72.205.26.142"&gt; &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
 &lt;/h2&gt;
</pre><br>
<p>You can see that we will return 72.205.26.142 in StringIndex 1</p>

<p><strong>Second, we build a "child" measure, to grab that information from StringIndex 1 of the "parent" measure.</strong><br>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeasureIPAddress]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureWebSite]
StringIndex=1
{% endhighlight %}

<p><strong>Now let's display the value of our first child measure in a meter:</strong></p>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeterIPAddress]
MeasureName=MeasureIPAddress
Meter=String
MeterStyle=TextStyle
Y=2
Text=IP Address: %1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>So this will display "IP Address: 72.205.26.142" on your skin as below:</p>
<div class="exampleprev">
<img src="/tips/img/webparser-guide/WebParserGuideImage02.jpg" width="300"/>
</div><br><br>
<p>Note that I kept the meters simple in the skin by using a MeterStyle section:</p>
{% highlight ini %}
[TextStyle]
X=2
Y=17r
FontFace=Segoe UI
FontSize=12
FontColor=230,250,247,255
StringStyle=Bold
Antialias=1
{% endhighlight %}

<p><strong>Now let's get the next bit of information we want from the website.</strong> (Remember, the RegExp reads the website in order from top to bottom, so you need to use the correct order in the "RegExp=" statement. You can display the information in any order you want on your skin however.)</p>
<p>The next bit in the Webpage.txt file is the "Country Code".</p>
<pre>
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;Country Code&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;input name="ro-no_bots_pls12" value="US" size="20" readonly&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</pre><br>

<p>So we want to add to our "RegExp=" statement, search for the Country Code and return the result in the next StringIndex on the parent measure:</p>
{% highlight ini %}
RegExp="(?siU)&lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15" value="(.*)"&gt;.*ro-no_bots_pls12" value="(.*)" size="20".*"
{% endhighlight %}
<p>So after the first pair of start/stop searches, we are adding:</p>
<code>.*ro-no_bots_pls12" value="(.*)" size="20".*</code>
<p>This will tell RegExp to skip everything until it finds ro-no_bots_pls12" value=" and then return everything until it sees " size="20" and put it in StringIndex 2. The result in my example will be "US".</p>
<p><strong>We will need another child measure to retrieve the data to display in our next meter:</strong></p>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeasureCountryCode]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=WebParser
URL=[MeasureWebSite]
StringIndex=2
{% endhighlight %}

<p><strong>And another meter to display the information:</strong></p>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeterCountryCode]
MeasureName=MeasureCountryCode
Meter=String
MeterStyle=TextStyle
Text=Country Code: %1
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>And so on...</h3>
<p>Ok, so you just carry on like that until you have retrieved all the data you want from the website. I won't lay it all out here, but you can go through the sample WebParserGuide.ini file installed by the .rmskin.</p>

<h3>Using "DEBUG" to make things easier</h3>
<p>Using The "<strong>Debug=1</strong>" statement in WebParser will cause your skin to output the index numbers and associated information into Rainmeter's log. Turn this on by putting "Debug=1" on your Measure:</p>
{% highlight ini %}
[MeasureWebsite]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=Plugins\WebParser.dll
UpdateRate=1800
Url=#URL#
RegExp=(?siU)&lt;h2&gt;IP Address to locate:&lt;input type="text" name="ipaddress" size="15" value="(.*)"&gt;.*ro-no_bots_pls12" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls13" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls14" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls15" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls16" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls17" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls10" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls19" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls9" value="(.*)" size="20".*ro-no_bots_pls4" value="(.*)" size="20"
Debug=1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then in Manage/Settings, check "Debug mode" and "Log to file". Refresh your skin and the log under Manage/Log will contain:</p>
<pre>
DBUG (04:38:07.000) WebParser.dll: [MeasureWebsite] (Index  1) 72.205.25.120

DBUG (04:38:07.000) WebParser.dll: [MeasureWebsite] (Index 11) North America
</pre>
<p>Which will show every index / data combination retrieved by your measure. Very useful for figuring out why your "RegExp=" statement isn't working right.</p>
<p>To turn the debugging off, remove the "Debug=1" statement from the measure, uncheck the boxes in Manage/Settings and delete the log file.  Refresh your skin.</p>
